# Pokedex

A modern Pokedex application built with **React** and **TypeScript**, using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokemon data.  

This project was created as a learning exercise to deepen my understanding of React and TypeScript while building a fun and interactive web application.
